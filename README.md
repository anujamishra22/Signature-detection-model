# Signature Detection Model
This project aims to detect signatures in images using YOLOv5. It involves the following steps:
1. Data Annotation
First, annotate your images using a tool like LabelImg. This will create XML files containing bounding box coordinates for each signature in the images.

2. Data Augmentation
Enhance the model's robustness by augmenting the dataset using transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling. This can be done using libraries like albumentations.

3. Model Selection
We use YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, for training the signature detection task. YOLOv5 is suitable for real-time object detection.

4. Model Training
Prepare a data.yaml file that defines paths to the training and validation datasets. Then, train the YOLOv5 model on the annotated and augmented data using ultralytics.

5. Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model on the validation set to measure its performance (e.g., mAP). This helps in assessing the modelâ€™s ability to detect signatures accurately.
